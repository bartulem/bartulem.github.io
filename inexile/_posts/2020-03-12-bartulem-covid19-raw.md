As the pandemic rages, thanks to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus" target="_blank">ourworldindata</a>, we can keep monitoring how the situation is developing around the world (on a daily basis).

In any case, take care of yourselves:
1. clean your hands often (use a sanitizer that's at least 60% ethanol)
2. avoid touching your face
3. avoid close contact with others
4. stay home if you're sick
5. clean & disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily
