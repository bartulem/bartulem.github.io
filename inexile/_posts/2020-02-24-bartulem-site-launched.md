    <p> <u>Who?</u> I was born and weaned on a failed, now long forgotten, pan-Slavic melting pot experiment in the southeast corner of Europe. My earliest memories conceal Greek mythology, befriending refugees & Eric Cantona (in that order). </p>
    <p> <u>What?</u> The what nots include political tirades, celebrities & Norwegian cuisine. All else, I guess, is open for discussion. </p>
    <p> <u>Why?</u> Due to an undying fascination with life and the unknown, but also everything in between. Tolstoy wrote "Life is too long to say anything definitely; always say perhaps" and I subscribe to that school of thought. </p>
    <p> <u>Else?</u> The language will switch between English and my mother tongue, depending on the targeted audience and philosophical inclination. </p>
