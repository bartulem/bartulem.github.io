William Blake (1757-1827), poet and visionary, author of "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" was an accomplished artist and printmaker, something I knew very little about until recently. Drawing upon Shakespeare (Pity), Dante (The Lovers Whirlwind), personal imagination or historical figures (Newton) he created stunning array of paintings not only steeped into his written work, but also pioneering a graphical style of expression that would not become popular for at least another half a century.
