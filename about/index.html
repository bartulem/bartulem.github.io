	<p>I am currently a Researcher at the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience/CNC in Norway, where I completed my PhD under the supervision of Jonathan Whitlock.</p>
	<p>In my graduate work, I used a combination of electrophysiological, optogenetic and computational methods to study how associative cortices in freely moving rats encode body posture. A part of this project was published in Science magazine in November 2018, and you can read more about it here.</p>
	<p>I am broadly interested in computational neuroethology, a burgeoning field invested in making sense of large streams of data that offer a detailed quantitative account of animal behavior in conjunction with neural recordings and manipulations. The challenge ahead is to characterize the specifics of how the brain represents parameters related to natural behavior during unrestrained bodily motion, especially during social interaction.</p>
	<p>Some of my other interests include literature, python, Manchester United and pisco sour.</p>
