	<p class="lead">I am currently a Researcher at the <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.ntnu.edu/kavli">Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience/CNC</a> in Norway, where I completed my PhD under the supervision of <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.whitlocklab.org/">Jonathan Whitlock</a>.</p>
		
	<p>In my graduate work, I used a combination of electrophysiology, optogenetics and computational methods to study how associative cortices encode body posture in freely moving rats. A part of this project was <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6414/584.editor-summary">published</a> in <i>Science</i> magazine in November 2018.

	<p>Nervous systems have evolved to solve a myriad of existential queries, bestowing the curse of infuriating complexity on the field of neuroscience. I am, nonetheless, fundamentally curious about animal behavior, both how it is persistently affected by periodic bouts of cellular activity and how it, in turn, shapes the intricate neuronal dynamics on sub-second scales.
