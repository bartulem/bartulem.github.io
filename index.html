	<p class="lead">I am a C.V. Starr Postdoctoral Fellow (2021—) at the <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://pni.princeton.edu/">Princeton Neuroscience Institute</a>, working under the joint supervision of <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.falknerlab.com/">Annegret Falkner</a> and <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://murthylab.princeton.edu/">Mala Murthy</a>, focused on the neuronal dynamics underlying naturalistic behavior and social communication.</p>
		
	<p>My graduate work with <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.whitlocklab.org/">Jonathan Whitlock</a>, on ensemble representations of posture in higher-order rodent cortices (2015—2019), was completed at the <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.ntnu.edu/kavli">Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience</a> in Norway.
	
	<p>Nervous systems have evolved to solve a myriad of existential queries, bestowing on me the magic of infinite curiosity about animal behavior, mainly how it is persistently affected by periodic bouts of cellular activity and how it, in turn, shapes the intricate neuronal dynamics on sub-second scales. To learn more about my research, browse through a compilation of recent <a style= "text-decoration: underline" href="https://bartulem.github.io/publications/">publications</a> or check out the full <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=aUeOyr8AAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a></p>
	
	<p>Some of my favorite pastimes, covered in the <a style= "text-decoration: underline" href="https://bartulem.github.io/chronicles/">chronicles</a> section, include r/w literature, data explorations in Python, enjoying pisco sour and enduring perpetual misery w/ Manchester United.</p>
