	<p class="lead">I am currently a Researcher at the <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.ntnu.edu/kavli">Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience/CNC</a> in Norway, where I completed my PhD under the supervision of <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.whitlocklab.org/">Jonathan Whitlock</a>.</p>
		
	<p>In my graduate work, I used a combination of electrophysiology, optogenetics and computational methods to study how associative cortices encode body posture in freely moving rats. A part of this project was <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6414/584.editor-summary">published</a> in <i>Science</i> magazine in November 2018.

	<p>Nervous systems have evolved to solve a myriad of existential queries, bestowing the curse of infuriating complexity on the field of neuroscience. I am, however, fundamentally curious about animal behavior, both how it is persistently affected by periodic bouts of neuronal activity and how it, in turn, shapes the intricate dynamics of the brain on sub-second scales. If interested further, check out my introductory discussion of this topic.</p>
	
	<p>Some of my favorite pastimes, covered in the in the <a style= "text-decoration: underline" href="https://bartulem.github.io/inexile/">in exile</a> section, include r/w literature & Python, enjoying pisco sour and enduring perpetual misery with Manchester United.</p>
