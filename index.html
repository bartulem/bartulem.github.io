	<p class="lead">I am a C.V. Starr Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://pni.princeton.edu/">Princeton Neuroscience Institute</a>, working under the joint supervision of <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.falknerlab.com/">Annegret Falkner</a> and <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://murthylab.princeton.edu/">Mala Murthy</a>.</p>
		
	<p>My graduate work with <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.whitlocklab.org/">Jonathan Whitlock</a> was completed in 2019 at the <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.ntnu.edu/kavli">Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience/CNC</a> in Norway. We used a combination of electrophysiology, optogenetics and computational methods to study how associative cortices encode body posture in freely moving rats. A part of this project was <a style= "text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6414/584">published</a> in <i>Science</i>.
	
	<p>Nervous systems have evolved to solve a myriad of existential queries, bestowing the curse of infuriating complexity on the field of neuroscience. I am, nonetheless, fundamentally curious about animal behavior, both how it is persistently affected by periodic bouts of cellular activity and how it, in turn, shapes the intricate neuronal dynamics on sub-second scales. If interested further, check out my introductory <a style= "text-decoration: underline" href="https://bartulem.github.io/scribe/2020/03/05/comp-neuroethology/">discussion</a> of this topic.</p>
	
	<p>Some of my favorite pastimes, covered in the in the <a style= "text-decoration: underline" href="https://bartulem.github.io/scribe/">scribe</a> section, include r/w literature & Python, enjoying pisco sour and enduring perpetual misery with Manchester United.</p>
