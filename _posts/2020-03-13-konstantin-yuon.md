Konstantin Yuon was an exceptionally gifted Russian painter whom I accidentally uncovered a couple of years ago, while browsing through some early Soviet art. Now I almost feel ashamed I hadn't known about him before.

What is it about Russian spirits like Yuon that makes me gravitate towards them? The Slavic connection?
