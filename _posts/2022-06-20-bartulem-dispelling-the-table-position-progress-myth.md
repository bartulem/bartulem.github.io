As the 2022/23 Premier League season approaches, also marking the beginning of yet another managerial reign at Manchester United, many fans are justifiably worried whether appropriate funds will be spent to reinforce a squad in dire need of an overhaul. In this context, there is a familiar trope of managers "not being backed", despite their achievements, most notably Mourinho having finished second in 2017/18.

Indeed, when considered over a period of 15 years, there has been notable variability in United's and our closest rivals' (Manchester City and Liverpool) final league position. However, while our rivals have become more consistent in their top flight finishes after Sir Alex retired in 2013, we start every season not knowing whether we would finish second or seventh, two outcomes with substantially different financial consequences. On two ocassions, once under Mourinho in 2017/18 and once under Solskj√¶r in 2020/21, a second place was achieved and both are often touted if not as sucesses, than definitely as proof of progress both managers were undertaking.
